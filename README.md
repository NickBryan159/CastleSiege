# Castle Siege
Tabletop Simulator File and game rulebook for the Castle Siege board game

This game was developed over the course of March 2021 to May 2021 in my Game Design and Development I class.  As classes were still being held asynchronously, the game was created by students using the Tabletop Simulator game as it allowed for a commmon framework for analog game development as well as online connection to play the game.

This game was developed by Nick Bryan, Chris Huston, Ethan Ball, and Zach Tatro
